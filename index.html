          Growing up, my favorite subject in school had to have been math. For
          me, math was logical with a right or wrong answer. As I started to
          take harder math classes, I viewed math as a puzzle. I enjoy seeing a
          problem and thinking about ways to fix them. It wasn’t until I was in
          college at Oregon State University that I learned coding. While I was
          in college, I always enjoyed when we had problems which required
          coding. Since graduation, I have found a passion for helping others
          learn or improve their knowledge. I have worked as a ski instructor
          predominating working with young children (3.5-5 yrs.), coached soccer
          to kids (8-10 yrs.), and tutor math at a community college. Now, it’s
          time for me to reset and think about what I like doing. It has led me
          to self-teaching myself how to coding a different language than
          college. In my spare time, I enjoy doing outdoor activities such as
          soccer, ultimate frisbee, skiing, and hiking. When I’m not outdoors,
          you’ll find me learning coding and listening to music.
